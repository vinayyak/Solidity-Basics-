# Solidity Basics
Notes for brushing up Solidity Basics

1. Structs & Enums -  a. Structs - Solidity allows user to create their own data type in the form of structure. The struct contains a group of elements with a different data type.
b. Enum- Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums. These values remain constant

2. Mappings - Mapping in Solidity acts like a hash table or dictionary in any other language. These are used to store the data in the form of key-value pairs, a key can be any of the built-in data types but reference types are not allowed while the value can be of any type. It's similar to a Dictionary in Python & is used to store a collection of data in Solidity. (Arrrays and Mappings are used to store collections of data in Solidity).
